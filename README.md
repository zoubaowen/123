## Overview

An open-source alternative to [OpenAI Codex Sites](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sites) / [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) / [v0](https://v0.dev) / [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) — an AI full-stack app development platform built on Tencent CloudBase. Describe what you want, the agent writes the code, you preview it live, and deploy with one click. Dual Agent runtimes (CodeBuddy / OpenCode), three-tier environment isolation, and full self-hosting on your own cloud.

> **Why this matters now**: OpenAI's Codex Sites (June 2026) lets ChatGPT Business / Enterprise users describe a site and have Codex host it on OpenAI-managed Cloudflare Workers infrastructure. Great for closed-ecosystem productivity, **but** — closed source, framework-locked (Workers ES modules only), agent-locked (OpenAI only), data lives at OpenAI, requires a paid ChatGPT seat. This project gives you the same conversational create → preview → deploy loop, but **fully open-source, on your own cloud, with any framework and any agent**.

### How we read this

According to Codex Sites' public materials: users invoke it via `@Sites` inside the Codex app to turn a natural-language description into a deployable website, web app, or game, hosted by OpenAI on a Cloudflare Workers-compatible runtime; D1 (database), R2 (object storage), and workspace-authenticated identity are available as optional bindings; the workflow is create → save a reviewable version → deploy to production; environment variables and access modes (`admins_only` / `workspace_all` / `custom`) are managed through the Sites panel in the sidebar.

This project implements: CodeBuddy / OpenCode dual agent runtimes, with CloudBase providing the database, object storage, Functions, domain, and CDN; MCP wires up tool calls; the sandbox runs on SCF + TCR container images (a stronger Agent Sandbox variant lives on the [`feature/stateful-infra`](https://github.com/TencentCloudBase/OpenVibeCoding/tree/feature/stateful-infra) branch); the main loop is create → live preview → one-click deploy, all running inside your own Tencent Cloud account.

## Why this project

### vs OpenAI Codex Sites

Codex Sites is closed-source, so we can only describe it from its public docs. The table below compares **what each system openly states**, not behind-the-scenes capability — feature parity is not the goal here.

### vs Lovable / v0 / bolt.new

These are closed SaaS products; the comparison below is at the level of **how the platform itself is delivered**, not feature-by-feature UX.

> We're not claiming our UX is better than these — they've had years and a lot of polish. The point is **shape**: same conversational create → preview → deploy loop, but in a form you can read, fork, and run yourself.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js >= 18
- Docker
- A Tencent Cloud account (CloudBase environment + API credentials)
- A CodeBuddy API Key or OAuth config

**One-shot init**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TencentCloudBase/OpenVibeCoding.git
cd OpenVibeCoding

# macOS / Linux / Git Bash / WSL
./init.sh

# Windows (make sure Node.js >= 18 and pnpm are installed first)
node scripts/init.mjs
```

The init script runs: Node.js check → pnpm install → `.env.local` generation → Docker check → CloudBase setup → dependency install → CodeBuddy auth → TCR setup → database init.

For detailed steps and troubleshooting, see [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

---

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start web (localhost:5174) and server (localhost:3001) together
pnpm dev:web      # Frontend only
pnpm dev:server   # Backend only
```

## Production

```bash
pnpm build        # Build all packages
pnpm start        # Start prod server (port 3001, serves API and static files)
```

## Deploy to CloudRun

This project supports one-click deployment to CloudBase CloudRun (container service). No local Docker required — the script uploads source code and Dockerfile to the cloud for building.

**Prerequisites**

- Completed `./init.sh` initialization (`TCB_ENV_ID`, `TCB_SECRET_ID`, `TCB_SECRET_KEY` configured)
- CloudBase CLI installed: `npm i -g @cloudbase/cli`

**One-click deploy**

```bash
pnpm deploy:cloud
```

The script will:
1. Upload source + Dockerfile to CloudBase for cloud-side image building
2. Deploy as a CloudRun container service (service name: `vibecoding-platform`, port: 80)
3. Query and display the service access URL

**After deployment**

- Access URL format: `https://{serviceName}-{id}.{region}.run.tcloudbase.com`
- Build progress can be viewed in [CloudBase Console](https://tcb.cloud.tencent.com) → CloudRun → Service Details → Deploy Records
- Environment variables should be configured in the console's service settings

## Common commands

```bash
# Code quality
pnpm type-check   # TypeScript type-check
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm format       # Prettier

# Database
pnpm db:generate  # Generate migrations
pnpm db:push      # Push schema
pnpm db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio

# TCR image registry
pnpm setup:tcr
pnpm setup:tcr --namespace my-app --local-image node:20

# OpenCode
pnpm opencode:setup   # Configure OpenCode provider and models
```

## OpenCode model configuration

The project ships with an OpenCode ACP runtime. To use the OpenCode agent from the frontend, configure at least one model provider first.

### Prerequisite: install the opencode CLI

```bash
npm i -g opencode-ai
# verify
opencode --version
```

### One-shot setup

```bash
pnpm opencode:setup
```

The command will:

1. Call the Tencent CloudBase AI+ endpoint [DescribeAIModels](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/876/131318) to fetch models
2. Walk you through configuring the Tencent CloudBase API Key
3. Take the complete config from the catalog and write it to `.opencode/opencode.json` (including npm / baseURL / models)
4. Append the API Key to `packages/server/.env`

### Example output

```jsonc
// .opencode/opencode.json (auto-generated; fields pulled from models.dev)
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "model": "cloudbase/deepseek-v4-flash",
  "provider": {
    "cloudbase": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://envId-xxxxxxx.api.tcloudbasegateway.com/v1/ai/cloudbase",
        "apiKey": "{env:CLOUDBASE_API_KEY}"
      },
      "models": {
        "glm-5": {
          "name": "glm-5"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# packages/server/.env gets the API Key appended
CLOUDBASE_API_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJS.xxxxxxxx
```

> **Why write the full fields instead of an empty object?** The opencode child process also needs these settings on startup. With just `{}`, the child would have to fetch the catalog from models.dev itself to learn npm / baseURL / models, and a network failure would break it. Writing the full fields makes the config self-contained, with no runtime network dependency.

### Advanced: custom provider / overrides

If you need to:

- Use a provider not in the built-in catalog (e.g. an internal LLM gateway, local Ollama)
- Override the catalog's default `baseURL` / `headers` (e.g. route through a regional mirror)
- Restrict which models are exposed via `whitelist` / `blacklist`
- Configure variants (e.g. Anthropic thinking budget)

Refer to `.opencode/opencode.example.json` and the [OpenCode providers docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/) and edit `.opencode/opencode.json` manually.

> Tip: the `$schema` field at the top of `opencode.json` enables auto-completion and hover docs in VS Code / Cursor — press Ctrl+Space while editing to inspect all available fields.

### Re-running / adding providers

`pnpm opencode:setup` is idempotent and can be run multiple times:

- **Existing providers** are not overwritten (to preserve manual tweaks)
- **Already-set env keys** are not asked for again
- **Providers with missing env** are flagged at startup

## CodeBuddy model configuration

By default the project uses CodeBuddy's (`@tencent-ai/agent-sdk`) official model service. To use custom AI models on CloudBase (e.g. DeepSeek, Hunyuan), configure as below.

### One-shot setup

```bash
pnpm codebuddy:setup
```

The command will:

1. Call the Tencent CloudBase AI+ endpoint [DescribeAIModels](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/876/131318) to fetch models enabled in the current environment
2. Check for `CLOUDBASE_API_KEY`; if missing, prompt for input and write it to `packages/server/.env`
3. Also set `CODEBUDDY_USE_CUSTOM_MODELS=true`
4. Generate `packages/server/.config/.codebuddy/models.json` for the SDK to read

### Example output

```jsonc
// packages/server/.config/.codebuddy/models.json (auto-generated)
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "deepseek-v4-flash",
      "name": "deepseek-v4-flash",
      "vendor": "cloudbase",
      "apiKey": "${CLOUDBASE_API_KEY}",
      "url": "https://envId-xxxxxxx.api.tcloudbasegateway.com/v1/ai/cloudbase",
      "supportsToolCall": true,
      "supportsImages": true
    }
  ],
  "availableModels": ["deepseek-v4-flash"]
}
```

```bash
# packages/server/.env gets auto-appended
CLOUDBASE_API_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJS.xxxxxxxx
CODEBUDDY_USE_CUSTOM_MODELS=true
```

> **About the `${CLOUDBASE_API_KEY}` placeholder**: the `apiKey` field in `models.json` uses `${VAR_NAME}` syntax, resolved at runtime by `@tencent-ai/agent-sdk` to the corresponding env value — avoids hard-coding secrets in config files.

### Syncing & custom models

`pnpm codebuddy:setup` is idempotent:

- **CloudBase models follow the API** — if you add or remove models in the CloudBase console, re-running the script syncs `models.json`
- **Already-set env keys** are not asked for again

### Manually adding custom models

To plug in non-CloudBase models (e.g. local Ollama, private LLM gateway), edit:

```bash
packages/server/.config/.codebuddy/models.json
```

Append a custom entry to the `models` array (note: do **not** set `vendor` to `cloudbase`, or the sync will overwrite it):

```json
{
  "id": "my-custom-model",
